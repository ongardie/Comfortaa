# Comfortaa font

Comfortaa is a sans font by Johan Aakerlund. This repo includes both version 1 and version 2 of the
font as TTF files.

While version 2 is widely available elsewhere, version 1 is somewhat difficult to find. Version 2 is
generally an improvement, but version 1 may be preferable for some uses, for example for the word
"raft" in the [Raft logo](https://github.com/raft/logo/).

These fonts are free to use per the [SIL Open Font License, version 1.1](v2.x/OFL.txt). If you'd
like to support Johan's work, see [v2.x/donate.txt](v2.x/donate.txt).
